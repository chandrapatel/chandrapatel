### Hi there 👋

My name is Chandra, I fell in love with WordPress in 2014 while freelancing as a web developer. I have grown since then to become a Core contributor, Translation contributor for Gujarati language, and has contributed to WordPress Meta projects.

Over the years, I have developed a love for learning, and hope to learn WordPress ever more “deeply”.
